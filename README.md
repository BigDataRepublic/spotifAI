spotifAI
==============================
Enter SpotifAI; an application that uses Machine Learning on historical data from Spotify to predict hits from the future.
These hits are then nicely packaged in a weekly Spotify playlist just for you, so you can listen to it before it will become mainstream!
Every friday at 12.00 CET the playlist refreshes with the top 20 of most promising tracks that were released in the past week.

Find our playlist and give it a like [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7oCxRqjtXpt5rwwY6nOK4m?si=869ace0ae4af4364)!
